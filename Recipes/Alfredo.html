            <li>
                6 1/2 tablespoons Heavy Cream </li>
            <li>
                6 tablespoons Butter </li>
            <li>
                1 lb. Pasta (we love Fresh Fettuccini Noodles) </li>
            <li>
                1 1/4 cup (2.5 oz.) fresh grated Parmesan </li>
            <li>
                1/4 teaspoon Fresh Ground Black Pepper, or to taste </li>

            <li>
                Pinch of Ground Nutmeg </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparing the Mushrooms</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saut&eacute; pan, heat olive oil for saut&eacute;ing, about a
                tablespoon. </li>
            <li>Add the mushrooms, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste (if desired)</li>

            <li >Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cooking the Pasta</h4>
        <ol>
            <li >In a large stock pot, add 4 quarts of water and a tablespoon of sea salt. Bring to
                a boil. </li>
            <li >Once the water is boiling, add the pasta, stirring to separate so it doesn't stick
                together, and cook to just under al dente (about 1 minute less according to package instructions). </li>
            <li >Add the broccoli to the boiling water during the last 2 minutes of the
                pasta&rsquo;s cooking time.</li>
            <li>Drain cooked pasta and broccoli and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Preparing the Pasta Alfredo</h4>
        <ol>
            <li >Combine 1 1/2 c of the half and half, butter, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a
                saut&eacute; pan large enough to accommodate the cooked pasta (or the same one used for the mushrooms if
                large enough, giving it a quick rinse out first).</li>
            <li >Heat the butter mixture over low until the butter is melted and the half and half
                is barely simmering. Stir periodically so the butter combines with the half and half as it melts.</li>
            <li>Drain cooked pasta and broccoli and add it to the saut&eacute; pan. </li>
            <li >Add the heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and mushrooms.</li>
            <li >Cook on low heat, tossing to combine the ingredients, until sauce is slightly
                thick, 2-3 minutes. Taste for seasonings, adding additional salt and pepper, if desired.</li>
            <li >Serve immediately in heated pasta bowls.</li>
        </ol>
