    <p>The <strong>ICE CREAM</strong> is a frozen sweet that is made of milk
        or water and sugar and sometimes we can add
        <em>fruits</em> to it

    </h3> Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
    dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and
    is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
    spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with
    fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by
    whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen
    together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to
    stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing
    point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent
    detectable ice crystals from forming. The
    result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low
    temperatures (below 2 ¬∞C or 35 ¬∞F). It becomes
    more malleable as its temperature increases.
    </p>
    <p>Also the ice cream is considered a colloidal system. It is composed
        by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air
        that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the
        bulk and partially coalesced fat globules.
        This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded
        by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by
        sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their
        interactions determine the properties of ice cream,
        whether soft and whippy or hard.</p>

        <h3><a href="#History">History of <b>Ice cream</b></a> </h3>
        <p><strong>Early frozen desserts </strong>
            The origins of frozen desserts are obscure, although several
            accounts exist about their history. Some sources
            describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back
            as 550 BC.

            A Roman cookbook dating back to the 1st-century includes recipes for
            sweet desserts that are sprinkled with
            snow.

            There are Persian records from the 2nd-century for sweetened drinks
            chilled with ice.

            There are Tang dynasty records of a chilled dessert made with flour,
            camphor and water buffalo milk.

            Kakigori was a Japanese dessert using ice and flavored syrup. The
            origins of kakig≈çri date back the Heian period
            in Japanese history, when blocks of ice saved during the colder
            months would be shaved and served with sweet
            syrup to Japanese aristocracy during the summer. Kakig≈çri's origin
            is referred to in The Pillow Book, a book of
            observations written by Sei Sh≈çnagon, who served the Imperial Court
            during the Heian period.

            The earliest known written process to artificially make ice is known
            not from culinary texts, but the
            13th-century writings of Arab historian Ibn Abu Usaybia in his book
            Kitab Uyun al-anba fi tabaqat-al-atibba
            (Book of Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians)
            concerning medicine in which Ibn Abu Usaybi‚Äôa
            attributes the process to an even older author, Ibn Bakhtawayhi, of
            whom nothing is known.

            Ice cream production became easier with the discovery of the
            endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could be
            chilled easily but not frozen. It was the addition of salt, that
            lowered the melting point of ice, which had the
            effect of drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze.</p>
