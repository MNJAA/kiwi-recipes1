        Mango Juice â€“ Nothing says summer like gulping down a big old glass of fresh, tropical tasting juice on a hot
        afternoon. This is one of my favorite drink recipes during mango season because itâ€™s quick and easy and, more
        importantly, super delicious. This one is for you, all my fellow mango lovers! ðŸ¥­

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2-3 ripe mangoes
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups of water
        </li>
        <li>
            Sugar or honey (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
            Mint herp (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash and peel the mangoes. Cut the flesh away from the pit and chop it into small pieces.

        </li>
        <li>
            Place the mango pieces in a blender or food processor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add water to the blender and blend the mixture until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste the juice and add sugar or honey if desired. This step is optional, as some mangoes are naturally very
            sweet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer to remove any pulp or fibers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Chill the juice in the refrigerator or serve over ice.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Optional variations:
    </h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add a squeeze of lime juice for extra zing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use coconut water instead of regular water to give the juice a tropical twist.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a pinch of salt and some cumin powder for a savory mango juice (known as aam panna in some Indian cuisines).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b> Enjoy your fresh Mango juice!...</b>
